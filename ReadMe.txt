This repository contains tools, intermediate results and the benchmark of our code clone study. The folder structure is as follows:

1_code-extractor - a small helper tool to download many solutions of a Google Code Jam contest

2_study-objects - the source code analysed by the clone detection tools we tested

3_detection-parameter - parameters for the clone detection tools we used

4_cloning-reports - reports generated by the clone detection tools

5_toolchain - our helper tool "CloneListCruncher" that analyses the cloning reports

6_toolchain-output - detailied reports about the clones generated by the CloneListCruncher

7_sample-analysis - results of a manual inspection of undetected clone pairs

8_statistical-analysis - statistical analysis of the study results with R

9_benchmark - a set of typical source file pairs that are clones but remained undetected
